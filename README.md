Weather Sprint Day 1 (12/15): Initialized Repo, started structuring the layout of the webpages and implemented a function to grab data from the weather API and console.log the data. 

Todays goals: complete structure and API calls into console.

Notes from client: 
    Two pages:
    Search bar has no dropdown
    Home will use geolocation at start!
    Under Icons will have text under 
    Change 7 day forecast to 5 day forecast

    Favorite Page:
    Will store 5 favorite cities.
    Functionality: button on all cards that can remove a favorite city.
        search bar will redirect to home page with user inputted city!
